                    <b>Soil: The Soul Of Earth</b>
                </h2><br>
                <p><b>'Soil'</b> which represents the entire natural world. Without soil there is no food
                    and without food there is no life, no trees, no forests. So soil represents life on Earth.
                    Soils affect the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe,
                    our health and the health of all organisms on the planet. Without healthy soils we wouldn’t be
                    able to grow our food. In fact, it is estimated that 95 percent of our food is directly or
                    indirectly produced on our soils.<br>
                <p>In our human-centred worldview, in our education systems, in our
                    study of science and technology, we have come to think that soil simply means dirt, and that dirt
                    means dirty. But dirt is not dirty: dirt is the source of life. Without dirt there is no life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Soil is so important, yet we have forgotten it. Yes, we humans are important too, but the human
                    species is only one of the 7.8 million species on Earth. We are not the kings. We are not an
                    imperial power and the Earth is not a human colony. At the moment we behave as if we can do what we
                    like. We can cause global warming, we can change the climate, we can alter the soil, we can destroy
                    the rainforests, we can overfish the oceans, we can interfere with seeds through genetic
                    engineering. This attitude must change.</p><br>

                <p>This is why I put the soil first. We are all part of this healthy web of life maintained by soil. It
                    makes us humble; to be human is to be humble. The Latin word humus means soil. ‘Humid’, ‘human’,
                    ‘humility’ and ‘humus’ all come from the same root. The soil is so fertile, yet humble. When humans
                    lose humility they are no longer humans.</p></br>
                
                <p>Once, the Buddha was sitting in meditation, with his right hand above the palm of the left hand, and
                    someone came to him and asked: “Lord Buddha, you teach compassion, forgiveness, love and forbearance
                    – from where did you learn all these wonderful qualities? Who is your teacher?” The Buddha lifted
                    his right hand in the bhūmiśpara mudra, which means ‘touch the Earth’ posture. Pointing towards the
                    soil, he said: “I learned my forgiveness, compassion, friendship, kindness and all the wonderful
                    qualities of love, beauty, unity and generosity from the Earth.”</p></br>
                </p>
                <p class="cont">
                    But we human for our need and greed we disturb this soil with various pollutants that had bad impact
                    on these soil and now become a global threat that is particularly serious in regions like Europe,
                    Eurasia,

                <p >
                    <b>Soil pollution</b> is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in
                    soil, in high enough
                    concentrations to pose a risk to human health and/or the ecosystem. In the case of contaminants
                    which occur naturally
                    in soil, even when their levels are not high enough to pose a risk, soil pollution is still said
                    to occur if the levels
                    of the contaminants in soil exceed the levels that should naturally be present.
                    For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of
                    contracting leukaemia.<br><br>
                <p>All soils, whether polluted or unpolluted, contain a variety of compounds (contaminants) which
                    are naturally present. Such
                    contaminants include metals, inorganic ions and salts (e.g. phosphates, carbonates, sulfates,
                    nitrates), and many organic
                    compounds (such as lipids, proteins, DNA, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, PAHs, alcohols, etc.).
                    These compounds are mainly
                    formed through soil microbial activity and decomposition of organisms (e.g., plants and
                    animals). Additionally, various
                    compounds get into the soil from the atmosphere, for instance with precipitation water, as well
                    as by wind activity or
                    other types of soil disturbances, and from surface water bodies and shallow groundwater flowing
                    through the soil. When
                    the amounts of soil contaminants exceed natural levels (what is naturally present in various
                    soils), pollution is generated.</p><br>
                <p>The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with
                    the contaminated soil,
                    vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and
                    underlying the soil.

                        change agricultural policy to help farmers stay on their land. As climate change

                        Technical Panel on Soils and collaborated with FAO to build national soil
                        information systems in seven Latin American countries.

                    </a>
                    <p> This NGO has used digital channels to protect and conserve the environment.
                        SankalpTaru is an e-NGO, which aims at promoting tree plantations across the
                        country. The plantation drive is run on a digital platform, allowing
                        SankalpTaru to use innovative technologies such as GPS-tagging. Through this
                        method, volunteers can track the progress of plantation drives. So far,
                        millions of trees have been planted since SankapTaru’s inception in 2013.
