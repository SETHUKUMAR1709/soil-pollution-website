            <p>&emsp;The origin of soil pollution may be natural or anthropogenic and therefore may have happened
                long ago
                or recently.
                Certain contaminants are often associated with specific activities, such as pesticide use in
                agriculture or
                radionuclides from nuclear power plants, while many others could result from a variety of sources of
                pollution.</p>

                <h2>Natural geogenic sources of soil pollution</h2><br>
                <p> &emsp;Contaminants such as trace elements, radionuclides, asbestos and other contaminants occur
                    naturally in soils
                    due to geological and pedological processes without anthropogenic influence .
                    In this instance, their concentration in the soil, at a given place and time, is called the
                    natural background concentration
                    . Natural soil background concentrations are variable, depending on the mineralogical
                    composition
                    of the soil parent material and on the pedogenetic (soil-forming) processes .
                    Organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can also occur in the environment
                    as a result of natural forest fires.</p><br>
                <div class="Trace">
                    <h3>Trace Element</h3><br>
                    <p> &emsp;Some elements are essential micronutrients to soil microorganisms, plants, and
                        animals, such
                        as iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn),
                        nickel (Ni), boron (B), selenium (Se) and molybdenum (Mo), while other elements have no
                        known metabolic function, such as lead (Pb),
                        cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg). When there is no anthropogenic influence, trace elements are
                        normally
                        present in low concentrations and do not pose problems for the environment or human health .
                        However, certain types of rocks have
                        particularly high concentrations of trace elements and are highly toxic to humans and other
                        species. Weathering and pedogenetic processes
                        may lead to increased concentration in soils . For example, the occurrence of geogenic
                        arsenic (As) occurs as a result of weathering of arsenic-containing minerals and ores , and
                        from naturally occurring mineralized zones of
                        arsenopyrite (gossans) that are formed by the weathering of sulphide-bearing rock or
                        concentrated through geothermal activity.
                        Soils in close proximity to ore deposits for a variety of trace elements may have much
                        higher concentrations of those elements as compared to background levels.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> &emsp;Volcanoes are major sources of elements such as aluminium (Al), copper, fluorine (F),
                        nickel, lead, manganese, mercury and zinc, spreading them from high crust depths
                        or the mantle to both atmosphere and soil as a result of lava, ash and gas emissions
                        Basaltic volcanic rocks of Réunion island are well-documented parent material with naturally
                        high content of trace elements. The soils developed from these volcanic
                        rocks have high natural background levels of mercury, chromium (Cr), copper, nickel and
                        zinc. Indonesian volcanic soils and Japanese volcanic soils also have high
                        concentrations of chromium and nickel. </p>

                <p>&emsp;Naturally occurring asbestos is comprised of fibrous silicate minerals and occurs in soils
                    formed
                    from ultramafic rocks such as serpentine and amphibole
                    These minerals have been extensively used in industrial and commercial applications for
                    centuries due to their physicochemical properties such as heat
                    stability, thermal and electrical insulation, flexibility, tensile strength, and resistance to
                    chemical and biological degradation
                    Asbestos is a known carcinogen causing mesothelioma and its mining and industrial use have been
                    regulated or even banned in many countries.
                    Due to its relevance to human health, many national institutions and research groups have made
                    efforts to identify areas rich in naturally occurring asbestos.

                <h2>Sources of soil pollution and major contaminants in agricultural areas</h2>
                <p>&emsp;Agricultural soils can be contaminated with a wide range of compounds, from both direct
                    inputs
                    (point source pollution) such as the application of
                    pesticides and fertilizers and indirect inputs (diffuse pollution) such as flooding and
                    atmospheric deposition. Polluted soils also represent a
                    secondary emission source of contaminants to surrounding air, surface waters, groundwater, and
                    subsequently to oceans.</p>
                </p> <br>

                <div class="pesticide">
                    <h3>Pesticide and Mineral Fertilizers</h3><br>
                    <p>&emsp;Heavy treatment of soil with pesticides can cause populations of beneficial soil
                        microorganisms to decline.
                        According to the soil scientist Dr. Elaine Ingham, “If we lose both bacteria and fungi, then
                        the soil degrades.
                        Overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have effects on the soil organisms that are
                        similar to human overuse of antibiotics.
                        Indiscriminate use of chemicals might work for a few years, but after awhile, there aren't
                        enough beneficial soil organisms to hold
                        onto the nutrients”. For example, plants depend on a variety of soil microorganisms to
                        transform atmospheric nitrogen
                        into nitrates, which plants can use. Common landscape herbicides disrupt this process:
                        triclopyr inhibits soil bacteria that transform
                        ammonia into nitrite ; glyphosate reduces the growth and activity of free-living
                        nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soi
                        and 2,4-D reduces nitrogen fixation by the bacteria that live on the roots of bean plants ,
                        reduces the growth and activity of
                        nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae , and inhibits the transformation of
                        ammonia into nitrates by soil bacteria . Mycorrhizal fungi grow with the roots
                        of many plants and aid in nutrient uptake. These fungi can also be damaged by herbicides in
                        the soil.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;The overuse of fertilizers in some regions and countries has led to worrying
                        environmental
                        problems such as the saturation of nutrients in soils and the loss of fertilizer via
                        leaching
                        to groundwater and via runoff to surface water leading to pollution of drinking water and
                        eutrophication
                        of freshwater rivers and lakes as well oceans. This excessive use is the result of several
                        factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>low price contrasted with perceived lack of downside to excessive use, as compared with

                        <li>lack of updated and accurate fertilizer recommendations for many crops, particularly
                            tree crops;</li>
                        <li>lack of awareness and training on the use of the product.</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    <p>&emsp;Overuse of nitrogen fertilizer leads to nitrogen losses from the soil through
                        volatilization,
                        denitrification,
                        leaching to groundwater, and through surface runoff and erosion. Depending on both the form
                        of nitrogen and on
                        soil conditions, nitrogen is transformed by microbial activity into nitrous oxide (N2O),
                        which is one of the
                        greenhouse gases responsible for global warming, and which contributes to depletion of the

                    <p>&emsp;Untreated wastewater contains a wide variety of pollutants from agricultural,
                        municipal, and
                        industrial sources.
                        Farmers, their families, people living near wastewater irrigation, and consumers of
                        wastewater-irrigated crops
                        are all at risk from excreta-related infections, skin irritants, and hazardous compounds
                        originating from these
                        sources . Heavy metal exposure from contaminated foods or inhalation of irrigated soil or
                        occupational ingestion has been related to a wide range of chronic health problems,
                        including cadmium, arsenic,

                        Long-term wastewater application causes a heavy metal build-up in soil and crops, which
                        affects crop
                        toxicity, soil functioning, food chain contamination, and vegetable nutritional quality
                        (Chen et al.,
                        2010; Singh et al., 2010). Heavy metals bio accumulate into vegetables, crops, and humans as
                        a result
                        of continual ingestion.</p>

                <h2>Source Of Soil Pollution in Urban or industrial area </h2><br>
                <h3>Urban Area</h3>
                <p>&emsp;Houses and commercial areas contain hundreds of thousands of chemicals. From
                    pharmaceuticals and
                    personal care products
                    (PPCPs), cleaning products, paints and solvents, flame-retardants, pesticides for in-house
                    insects and gardening, the
                    domestic environment is potentially exposed to a great variety of organic and inorganic
                    contaminants. When discussing
                    indoor pollution, consideration is given primarily to air pollution’s impact on human health,
                    but rarely to the impact
                    and the routes of entry into the soil and thus on the environment. However, even though the
                    largest influx of contaminants
                    into the soil from urban and commercial activities is through transport and waste, it is
                    important to consider other entry routes.
                    One of the major concerns for human health and the environment is the presence of lead in soils,
                    which in urban areas is mostly associated
                    with the use of lead-based paints and transport emissions. Due to its high biotoxicity,
                    bioaccumulation and persistence, no safe level of
                    exposure to lead has been determined</p><br>
                <h3>Industrial Area</h3>
                <p>&emsp;Waste generated by manufacturing or industrial activities is referred to as industrial
                    waste.
                    Cafeteria waste, dirt and gravel, masonry
                    and concrete, scrap metals, trash, oil, solvents, chemicals, weed grass and trees, timber and
                    scrap lumber, and similar wastes are all
                    examples of industrial waste. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste are two types of industrial
                    solid waste, which might be solid, liquid,
                    or gas in containers. Manufacturing and other industrial operations can produce hazardous waste.
                    Hazardous waste includes certain
                    commercial items such as cleaning fluids, paints, and insecticides that are disposed by
                    businesses or individuals.</p>
