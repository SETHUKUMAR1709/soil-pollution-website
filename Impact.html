            <p>&emsp;It is widely and undoubtedly recognized that soil enables and sustains life on Earth.
                Soil provides goods and services for the well-being of humans and for the environment thanks
                to the natural processes that occur within its matrix and the interaction of biotic and abiotic soil
                components.Soils host a quarter of the world’s biodiversity and are an essential component of water
                and
                nutrients cycles, and in the moderation of the earth’s temperature . In addition, many anthropogenic
                activities depend on soils as a source of raw materials and as support of human infrastructure.</br>

                Soils, however, are constantly under threat by multiple
                anthropogenic and abiotic pressures that cause soil degradation, including physicochemical
                degradation caused
                by contaminants, which reduce capacity to provide much-needed ecosystem services. Global
                climate change alters precipitation patterns and raises temperatures, leading to the emergence and
                increased
                recurrence of pests and diseases and altering water availability.</p>

                <h2>Ecosystems impairment caused by Soil Pollution</h2><br>
                <p> &emsp;Soil pollution affects above- and below-ground biodiversity in two main ways.
                    The number of organisms can be reduced due to the toxicity caused by the contaminants,
                    but also changes can be observed at community level in that tolerant or resistant organisms
                    will benefit compared to those sensitive to the contaminants. It has also been observed that
                    the exposure to some trace elements can induce resistance in soil microorganisms and also
                    promote
                    resistance to antimicrobials (Heydari, 2020). In addition, soil contaminants can enter the food
                    chain
                    and cause disease and mortality in soil-dwelling, terrestrial (including humans) and aquatic
                    organisms.
                    The loss of biodiversity and biomass therefore leads to a decrease in organic matter and changes
                    in nutrient
                    inputs and cycling. This affects the primary productivity of natural and agricultural ecosystems
                    and leads to
                    the overall loss of soil ecosystem services.</p><br>


                <div class="Soil-Degradation">
                    <h3>Soil degradation and loss of soil ecosystem services</h3><br>
                    <p> &emsp;Soil ecosystems services are provided by an interaction of abiotic soil components
                        (soil organic carbon, mineral fractions, soil solution, and pore air) and living organisms
                        (from genes to macro-organisms) present in soils. However, global soils are being depleted
                        and degraded by the constant pressures of a growing population that demands more services
                        and benefits. Soils are also under threat from global challenges,
                        such as by biodiversity loss, imbalances in biogeochemical cycles, chemical pollution,
                        climate change and the hydrogeological cycle, and land use change.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> &emsp;Changes in soil properties that control the soil contaminant buffering and filtering
                        capacity
                        can cause a decrease in the protection mechanisms and instead act as a source, potentially
                        releasing
                        contaminants into other environmental compartments (water, air and organisms).
                        Pollution induced soil degradation can become an iterative cycle of degradation that can
                        ultimately lead to the loss of ecosystem services. </p>

                <h2>Soil pollution and risk to human health</h2>
                <p>&emsp;Soil pollution affects food security in two ways.
                    First, soil pollution can reduce crop yields; this is because toxic pollutants degrade soils
                    over the long term. Second, soil pollution can make foods unsuitable for human consumption</p>
                <p>Human exposure to soil pollution is estimated to contribute to more than 500,000 premature
                    deaths globally each year (Landrigan et al., 2018). Most of these deaths occur in vulnerable
                    groups, such as children and the elderly, affected by long-term exposure. Moreover, these
                    deaths are related to exposure to only a limited range of pollutants; the impacts of all
                    soil contaminants on health and well-being are likely to be greater.</p>
                <p>Depending on the chemicals involved, soil pollutants can affect various organs, such as the
                    lungs, skin, gut, liver and kidneys. These pollutants can also affect the immune, reproductive,
                    nervous and cardiovascular systems, and more. Evidence suggests that the health impacts of soil
                    pollution disproportionally affect poorer households; for example, poorer households have higher
                    chances of living close to industrial sites and being exposed to contaminated soils</p>
                    <div class="video">

                        </iframe>
                    </div>
                <p>Hotspots for human exposure to soil pollution are contaminated sites, certain agricultural
                    and urban soils, and land that has previously been flooded. A German study monitored toxic
                    pollutants in floodplain soils across the Elbe River in central Europe and assessed health risks
                    The Elbe River and its tributaries are among the most highly polluted rivers in Europe due to a
                    history of intensive industrial activity taking place over centuries. At the same time, these
                    floodplain soils are highly fertile and often used for agriculture. Around the Central Elbe
                    River,
                    arsenic was found to be the primary contributor to total health risk — with chromium second,
                    vanadium third and lead fourth. The study found that children’s health was at dramatically more
                    risk than adults’.</p>
                <p>High and increasing concentrations of cadmium have been found in agricultural topsoil across
                    Europe; this mainly comes
                    from phosphate fertilisers. Cadmium is a heavy metal; diet is the principal exposure route in
                    non-smokers
                    (smokers are routinely exposed to cadmium through cigarette smoke). It is linked to harmful
                    health effects, including renal
                    toxicity and osteoporosis. The Mediterranean area, in particular, was found to be very sensitive
                    to the
                    accumulation of cadmium due to local soil properties which affect retention of metals in the
                    soils </p>
                <h3>Percentage of participants (non-smoking adults, aged 20-39) with cadmium above guideline
                    values across nine European countries, conducted between 2014 and 2020</h3><br>

                    <h3>Pathways for exposure</h3><br>
                    <p>&emsp;Human beings are in close contact with the environment and the natural resources
                        on which our well-being depends. All components of the environment - water, air, land,
                        &emsp;organisms - are interconnected and interrelated. Soil is the key link in the
                        functioning of ecosystems.</p>
                    <ul>
                        &emsp; <li>Ninety-five percent of our food is produced directly or indirectly from the soil,
                            including both plant
                            and animal products that depend on the nutrients provided by the soil.</li>
                        &emsp; <li>Soil regulates the exchange of gases with the atmosphere and contributes to both
                            the storage and release
                            of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, N2O or CH4, but also of volatile and gaseous
                            contaminants such as mercury,
                            radon, volatile organic contaminants or some POPs </li>
                        &emsp; <li>Soils accumulate less than 1 percent of the global water, but this tiny amount is
                            essential to sustain terrestrial
                            ecosystems. Soils filter water from rainfall or irrigation, store water, support plant
                            growth water needs, and allow
                            the redistribution vertically and horizontally to ground and surface water bodies, thus
                            regulating quality and quantity</li>

            <h2>Socio-economic impacts of soil pollution</h2>
            <h3>Social impact os Soil Pollution</h3>
            <p>
                Soil pollution exerts profound social impacts on communities and their well-being. Contaminated soil
                poses significant
                health risks, as exposure to pollutants can lead to diseases and long-term health issues. Reduced
                agricultural productivity
                resulting from soil pollution affects food security, increases prices, and disrupts the livelihoods
                of farmers and local
                economies. This can, in turn, lead to the displacement of communities, raising issues of land rights
                and exacerbating social
                inequalities. Furthermore, soil pollution often disproportionately affects marginalized groups
                living near contamination sources,
                creating social injustices. Cleanup costs strain government budgets and may divert resources from
                essential social programs, while
                legal and regulatory disputes can lead to lengthy battles and social and economic consequences.
                Overall, soil pollution not only
                impacts human health but also has far-reaching social and economic ramifications that necessitate
                attention and action for mitigation
                and prevention.</p>

                    <h2>Economic costs of soil pollution</h2>
                    <p>Soil pollution has a direct cost of remediation and management that is easily perceived by
                        society and policy makers.
                        The cost of identifying and characterizing potentially polluted soils is very high, and risk
                        management strategies are
                        often applied, which rely on a more detailed desk study, which is often less costly than
                        laboratory analysis of multiple
                        samples. The cost of remediation varies from site to site depending on the characteristics
                        of the site, such as the size
                        of the affected area, the concentration of contaminants, the environmental compartments to
                        be remediated (topsoil, vadose
                        zone, groundwater, surface water), the protective measures for the population during the
                        remediation work, the acceptable
                        level to be achieved depending on the land use after remediation, as well as the technology
                        chosen . Some of the countries
                        contributing to this report indicated that they spend an average ranging from tens of
                        thousands of dollars annually, as reported
                        by countries such as Ecuador or the Kingdom of Eswatini, to tens or hundreds of millions of
                        dollars annually, as in the case of
                        Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, or Belgium. National experts estimate that the cost of
                        remediating all polluted soils in China
                        could run into hundreds of billions of dollars.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are, however, other indirect costs that are often neglected, leading to underestimation
                        of the impacts of soil pollution .
                        Many ecosystem services are hampered by soil pollution, losing productivity and resilience
                        in the long term. An example of
                        estimating the cost of pollution due to loss of ecosystem services was carried out by Garcia
                        and co-workers in relation to the collapse of
                        the Samarco Corporation mine-tailings dam. The authors estimated that the toxic sludge
                        affected over 8 million hectares and resulted in the
                        loss of ecosystem services worth USD 521 million per year .</p>
                    <h3>Quantifiable economic losses due to soil pollution are loss of soil productivity and
                        reduction of crop yields, contamination of food products and loss of marketability,
                        reduction of biodiversity, and reduction of water quality.</h3>

                    <ol type="1">

                        <li><strong>Reduced Agricultural Productivity:</strong> Soil pollution can lead to reduced
                            crop yields and
                            poor-quality produce. Contaminants in the soil can harm plant growth, decrease nutrient
                            availability, and affect the health of crops. Farmers may experience lower profits due
                            to reduced harvests and increased input costs to combat soil contamination.</li><br>

                        <li><b>Increased Agricultural Costs:</b> Dealing with soil pollution often requires
                            remediation
                            efforts, such as soil testing, cleanup, and the use of alternative farming methods.
                            These measures can be costly for farmers and agricultural enterprises, leading to
                            increased production expenses.</li><br>

                        <li><b>Health Care Costs: </b>Soil pollution can result in the contamination of food and
                            water
                            supplies, potentially leading to health issues in humans and livestock. The economic
                            burden of healthcare costs associated with soil pollution-related illnesses can be
                            significant.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Reduced Land Value:</b> Soil pollution can decrease the value of land, making it less
                            attractive for real estate development and other commercial purposes. Property owners
                            may face difficulties in selling their land or may have to sell it at a reduced price.
                        </li><br>
                        <li><b>Cleanup and Remediation Costs:</b> Cleaning up contaminated soil can be an expensive
                            and
                            time-consuming process. Government agencies, landowners, or businesses responsible for
                            the pollution may be required to invest in costly soil remediation efforts, which can
                            strain financial resources.
                        </li><br>

                        <li><b>Legal Liabilities and Fines:</b> Businesses or individuals responsible for soil
                            pollution
                            may face legal actions and fines, which can have a direct impact on their finances.
                            Legal disputes and settlements can lead to substantial economic consequences.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Reduced Ecosystem Services:</b> Soil pollution can harm ecosystems, affecting
                            services such
                            as water purification, nutrient cycling, and habitat support. The loss of these services
                            can result in higher costs for water treatment and other ecosystem-dependent activities.
                        </li><br>

                        <li><b>Tourism and Recreation:</b> Soil pollution can negatively affect the attractiveness
                            of
                            recreational areas and tourist destinations, impacting the tourism industry in affected
                            regions. Reduced tourist activity can lead to lost revenue for local businesses.</li><br>

                        <li><b>Supply Chain Impacts:</b> Industries dependent on agricultural products may face
                            disruptions
                            in their supply chains due to reduced crop yields and poor-quality raw materials. This
                            can result in increased costs and potential product shortages.</li><br>

                        <li><b>Long-Term Economic Consequences:</b> Soil pollution can have long-lasting economic
                            effects,
                            as the impacts on soil quality and ecosystems may persist for many years. This can
                            hinder economic development and sustainable growth in affected areas.
