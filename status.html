                    <Li>USA has lost 831 square miles of forest during the period 2001 – 2005.</Li>
                    <li>500 years are need for the regeneration of 2.5 cm of topsoil.
                        The US loses topsoil 17 times faster than its being formed again.</li>
                    <li>Americans are only 5% of the world population but produce 30% of the waste globally.</li>
                    <li>200 000 tonnes of completely edible food is being thrown away each day only in US.
                        Its decomposure significantly emits methane in the soil.</li>
                    <li>According to US Fire Administration, in 2001 an estimate of 8100 fires happened,
                        many of which due to natural ignition of landfills because of the heat generated from the
                        emissions.
                        That produces huge amount of gases that further cause air pollution.</li>
                    <li>22 barrels of toxic waste was disposed in the Love Canal, US in the late 1970s.
                        Many of the families living nearby the place of disaster later suffered from Leukemia,
                        high red blood cells count. It took about 30 years for the area to become inhabited again.</li>
                    <li>The Murphy Refinery spill happened because of malfunction of a storage tank due to a massive
                        flood.
                        Over 1700 homes were impacted by the massive spill of about 90 000 barrels of oil –
                        approximately 4 million gallons.</li>
                    <li>The average american produces 4.5 (about 2kg) pounds of rubbish a day.
                        About 40% of the lakes in the U.S. are so severely polluted that fishing and
                        swimming in them is not allowed. The aquatic life doesn’t exist or is heavily damaged.</li>

                <ul class="listall">
                    <li>82.8% of the soil in China contains contaminants such as copper, lead, mercury,
                        arsenic etc making China one of the most affected countries by the world pollution.</li>
                    <li>One of the leading reasons for China’s soil contamination is
                        the rapid increase of population since 1980.</li>
                    <li>100, 000 km² of China’s cultivated
                        land is highly polluted and food cultivation in it is either impossible or extremely dangerous.
                    </li>
                    <li>2 million miles of land has been destroyed because of solid waste.
                        19 million tonnes of grain is contaminated every year because of heavy metals due to land
                        pollution. That results in $2.6 billion of loses.</li>
                    <li>82.8% of the land pollutants in China are not organic.
                        China produces 12 million tonnes of grain a year that is contaminated by
                        heavy metals which is worth $3.2 billion.</li>
                    <li>Research in the period of 2013-2015 shows that 16% and 19% of the arable land of China soil is
                        contaminated .</li>

                <h3>Soil Pollution in India</h3>
                <p>India's environmental protection started as early as in the 1970s; it has stringent environmental
                    policies and regulatory instruments in place. The government implemented a nationwide ban on
                    single-use
                    plastics in late 2019. Despite this, the environmental conditions deteriorated
                    as a result of increased industrial production since the 1990s.</p>
                <ul class="listall">
                    <li>NEW DELHI: The “State of India’s Environment 2022”, a report released by Centre for Science and
                        Environment (CSE) on Thursday, stated that nearly 62% of land in Delhi was under degradation.
                        Almost 30% of India’s geographical area is under degradation.

                <p>Large quantities of people living close together, producing trash, and littering in a dense area does
                    inevitably lead to land pollution. To accommodate our increasing population,
                    construction activities also occur, which result in large waste materials, such as metal, plastic,
                    wood and bricks.
                    When these materials are not properly disposed of, it contributes to the land pollution of that
                    area. To help reduce the environmental
                    impact of construction sites, it’s important to work with partners that offer comprehensive
                    solutions to achieve cost-effective construction recycling and waste disposal plans.<br><br>

                <p>Six heavy metals (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in 139 top soil samples collected in and around oil and
                    natural gas
                    drilling sites at a sampling density of 1 site/12 km2. The results indicated the concentration
                    ranged from 0.1
                    to 16 mg/kg for As, 3–707 mg/kg for Cr, 7–2324 mg/kg for Cu, 14–234 mg/kg for Ni, 9–1664 mg/kg for
                    Pb, and 60–962
                    mg/kg for Zn. The contamination of soil was estimated on the basis of Index of geo accumulation
                    (Igeo), enrichment
                    factor (Ef), and contamination factor (Cf).<br><br> Further, spatial distribution pattern maps
                    indicated that the pollution
                    levels for Cu, Cr, Zn, and Ni were higher around drilling sites of the study area relative to other
                    regions. Using
                    exposure factors for the local population and references from the USEPA’s integrated database,
                    potential ecological
                    risk indices (PERI) and health risk assessments were made. The hazard index (HI) values of Pb (in
                    adults) and Cr, Pb
                    (in children) exceeded the recommended limit of HI = 1, indicating the non-carcinogenic risks. Total
                    carcinogenic risk
                    (TCR) calculations revealed Cr (in adults) and As, Cr (in children) levels in soils exceeded the
                    threshold value of 1.0E − 04,
                    indicating significant carcinogenic risk due to high metal concentrations in the study area.</p>

                <p>Deir Ez Zor is the largest city in Eastern Syria. Salinity affected the growth of crops and
                    vegetables, the quality of groundwater, and even the
                    infrastructure of roads and buildings.

                <h3>Status of soil pollution in Near East and North Africa</h3>
                <p>&emsp;This assessment of drivers of soil pollution in the NENA region was compiled from a review of
                    147 papers and reports. It revealed a wide disparity
                    in the availability of information on soil quality, the sources and risks of soil pollution, and its
                    remediation in each of the countries. The Islamic
                    Republic of Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestine and Saudi Arabia are the most studied countries within
                    the region. There is a lack of soil quality studies
                    in Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Sudan and Yemen. In addition to the lack of information from certain
                    countries, there is a general lack of literature on
                    specific topics, such as the impact of armed conflicts on soil pollution.</p><br>

                <p>&emsp;Trace elements and many other contaminants become attached to eroded soil particles and settle
                    as sediments in water bodies. Floods can then mix these
                    sediments with lowland soils. Bed sediments and adjacent flood soils of the Ibrahim River (Lebanon)
                    show elevated levels of cadmium, chromium, copper, iron,
                    manganese, nickel, lead and zinc, from the upstream source to the sea outlet (Korfali and Davies,
                    2004). Korfali and Davies (2005) studied Mediterranean soils
                    developed from calcareous rocks to determine the fate and seasonal variation of trace elements in
                    weathered and transported soil particles. <br><br>&nbsp; The results showed
                    an increase in the total iron content in Fluvisols (a soil with fluvial origin) after winter floods,
                    but the total concentration and availability of cadmium,
                    copper and lead decreased due to the increase in the carbonate-linked forms of the trace elements.
                    This finding was used to postulate about river self-purification
                    in Mediterranean karst areas. However, this conclusion can only be justified in undisturbed basins.
                    In highly populated watersheds with diverse anthropogenic
                    activities and pressures, eroded soil material and direct discharge in winter can bring additional
                    contaminants into low lands such as the coastal flood plain.</p><br>

                    indicate the “potential negative impacts of industrial pollutants” notably
                    zinc, cadmium, chromium, lead, copper and mercury partly derived from phosphogypsum and other
                    industrial wastes (El Zrelli et al., 2015). The pollution load index
                    (PLI) values ranged between 1.27 and 26.25. Compared to the classification of Tomlinson et al.
                    (1980), these surface sediments, with their mean PLI value of 4.43,
                    should be classified as “polluted”.</p><br>
